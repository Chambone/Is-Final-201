     <h1> Dark And Darker Under Attack!</h1>
     <h3> Dark and Darker is a new video Game from an up and coming developer called Ironmace. Right now they are under being sued by 
        a larger video game company called Nexon. That sucks because Dark and Darker is super fun, and the big game corporation is trying 
        to stomp that out because they don't like competition and they don't want to lose money. 
     </h3>
     <h3> Below is the cover image for the game</h3>

    <h3> OnePeg is a popular Youtuber who has been following the Dark and Darker lawsuit very closely. While he tries to be objective,
        he admits to being slightly biased in favor of Ironmace. However, I think that he covers both sides of the argument well.
         The videos below will first show the lawsuit released by Nexon, and then the counter by Ironmace

        <h3> I love Dark and Darker and I also love small businesses because I think that they can add so much to the marketplace.
            Don't Let a big company squash its competition. FIGHT FOR IRONMACE!!!!
